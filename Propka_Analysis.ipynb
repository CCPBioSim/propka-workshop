    "# Propka analysis of a protein structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates the application of [Propka](https://github.com/jensengroup/propka-3.1) to the analysis of the pKas of acidic and basic residues in the structure of the cysteine protease cruzein (PDB code 2oz2).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Propka` is a command-line application and you will work with it in the terminal window. This Jupyter notebook window provides the step-by-step instructions, and also the molecular structure viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `Propka` itself, the tutorial makes use of two further Python packages:\n",
    " - [nglview](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/): A package to embed a molecular viewer in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    " - [mdtraj](http://www.mdtraj.org): a very useful trajectory analysis package.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have the Python packages `propka`, `nglviewer` and `mdtraj` installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "All can be installed using `pip`:\n",

    "    pip install mdtraj\n",
    "    pip install nglviewer\n",
    "    pip install propka\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You also need a copy of the PDB file `2oz2.pdb` in the `./data` directory below the one you launch this notebook from. If it's not already here, download it from the [PDB website](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/2oz2).\n",
