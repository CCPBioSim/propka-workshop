# propka-workshop

A vital part of preparing a protein structure for MD simulation is the assignment of protonation states to acidic and basic residues. 'Black box' tools that come with certain MD packages can have limitations, so using a more sophisticated 3rd-party software tool to check this is always a good idea.

This short workshop illustrates the application of [Propka](https://github.com/jensengroup/propka-3.1) to the analysis of the pKas of acidic and basic residues in the structure of the cysteine protease cruzein (PDB code 2oz2) - the results may not be what you would have expected!

## Requirements
A basic knowledge of Python and MD simulation methods

## Training material
A Jupyter notebook and associated data files
